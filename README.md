## What are Agent Skills?

Agent skills are modular, standardized capability packages that give agents on-demand abilities.

In practice, a skill is usually a small SKILL.md file that defines:

- When it should be used

- How the task should be executed

- What constraints and best practices apply

Skills follow a model of progressive disclosure: lightweight metadata loads first, and full instructions are loaded only when the skill becomes relevant.

This allows agents to stay fast and focused, while still executing tasks with real depth when needed.

## FAQ: Agent Skills

### What are Agent Skills?
Agent Skills are instruction files that teach AI agents how to perform specific tasks. You can think of them as practical guides that the agent reads and follows when it needs to solve a problem. They are only loaded when relevant, so the agent stays fast and focused.

---

### How do Agent Skills work in practice?
The agent initially reads only the name and description of all available skills. When it identifies that a skill is relevant to the current task, it loads the full content and follows those instructions to execute the work.

This allows you to teach new behaviors without changing the model, retraining anything, or adding complexity to the setup.

---

### Are Agent Skills the same as saved prompts?
No.

A saved prompt is just text that you manually paste or reuse. Agent Skills are structured instructions with context, rules, examples, workflows, and sometimes supporting assets. They become part of how the agent works, not just reusable text.

---

### What’s the difference between Agent Skills and fine-tuning?
- **Fine-tuning** permanently changes how the model behaves. It’s expensive, slow to iterate, and hard to roll back.  
- **Agent Skills** are runtime instructions. You can create, edit, test, version, swap, or remove them at any time without touching the model.

In practice: skills give you flexibility. Fine-tuning gives you rigidity.

### What’s the difference between Agent Skills and MCP?
They solve different problems and work extremely well together:

- **Agent Skills** define *how the agent should think and act* → workflows, best practices, rules, checklists, patterns  
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** defines *how the agent accesses the outside world* → APIs, databases, tools, and services  

In short:  
Skills teach **how to work**.  
MCP provides **access to tools**.

### Can skills run code or automations?
Depending on the platform, yes. Many allow attaching scripts and commands. This makes skills far more powerful, but also requires caution. Treat skills as executable code: review them carefully and only run what you trust.

### How to create a good Agent Skill?

1. **Clear scope**  
   Each skill should solve one well-defined problem.

2. **Objective description**  
   Name and description must clearly state when the skill should be used.

3. **Practical step-by-step instructions**  
   Explain exactly how the agent should reason, analyze, and respond.

4. **Explicit output format**  
   Define how the final answer must be structured.

5. **Real examples**  
   Good examples are more valuable than long explanations.
